## Özet

Resonance-Based Spaces introduces a novel conceptual framework within the 
Resonance Data and Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing (QIRC) paradigm.

This work establishes prior art and formal vocabulary for a framework for meaning-centric spatial design.

---

## What This Is

Resonance-Based Spaces is a conceptual framework that:
- Provides formal definitions
- Establishes terminological clarity
- Enables scientific discourse
- Extends Resonance Data principles

---

## What This Is NOT

This work does NOT:
- Claim new physics
- Require quantum hardware
- Assert consciousness
- Disclose implementation details
