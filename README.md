## Abstract

Resonanzbasierte Räume (Resonance-Based Spaces) represent a novel conceptual framework 
for understanding and designing physical and virtual spaces through the lens of 
resonance and meaning coherence.

This work extends the Resonance Data paradigm to spatial design, proposing that 
meaningful spaces are not defined by geometry alone, but by their capacity to 
sustain and amplify resonance states.

---

## Definition

**Resonanzbasierte Räume** are spaces—physical, virtual, or conceptual—designed 
according to principles of:
- Resonance amplification
- Meaning coherence preservation  
- Temporal stability of significance
- Multi-level semantic layering

---

## What This Is

Resonanzbasierte Räume is a conceptual framework that:
- Provides formal definitions for meaning-centric spatial design
- Establishes terminological clarity for resonance-based architecture
- Enables scientific discourse on intelligent city design
- Applies Resonance Data principles to urban and spatial contexts

---

## What This Is NOT

This work does NOT:
- Claim new physics
- Require quantum hardware
- Assert consciousness or sentience
- Disclose implementation details
- Provide engineering specifications

---

## Applications (Conceptual)

- Smart City Design (e.g., NEOM, future cities)
- Virtual Reality Environment Design
- Workspace Optimization
- Urban Planning Frameworks
- Architectural Theory

---

## Relationship to Resonance Data

Resonanzbasierte Räume extends the core Resonance Data paradigm:

| Resonance Data | Resonanzbasierte Räume |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Information states | Spatial zones |
| Temporal coherence | Spatial persistence |
| Meaning collapse | Decision points in space |
| Resonance amplification | Spatial enhancement |

---

## Scope and Limitations

This is a **conceptual framework**, not:
- A building specification
- An engineering manual
- A product description

Implementation remains open for future development.
